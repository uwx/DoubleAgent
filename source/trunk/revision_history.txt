Double Agent Revision History
========================================================================

Version 1.0
===========

	Build 1.0.0.29
	--------------
	
	This is the first stable release
		
	Build 1.0.0.30
	--------------
	
	Several minor bugs fixed:
	
	-	The "Move" action was fixed to make the character move
		smoothly at a constant speed.

	-	The Agent Character specification indicates that transparent
		pixels in the animations are identified by a single palette
		INDEX (the transparent index).  However, some character files
		use a transparent COLOR, where the palette defines many indices
		with the same color as the transparent index, and any of these
		indices should be treated as transparent.
		
		MS Agent tolerates this, so Double Agent has been updated
		to do so as well.

	-	In the process of debugging the lip-sync for TTS speech, the
		lip-sync for WAV-file speech got messed up. A partial fix has
		been made, but the final fix will have to wait for the next
		version.
	
	-	If a "Speak" or "Think" action was queued, and then the balloon
		settings were changed before the action	started, the balloon
		settings at the time the action	starts would be used.
		
		This has been changed so that the balloon settings at the time
		the action is queued will be used.  It's a minor unlikely bug,
		but irritating when it happens.

	Build 1.0.0.31
