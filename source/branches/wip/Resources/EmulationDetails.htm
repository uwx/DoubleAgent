<p>Normally, both Microsoft Agent and Double Agent are installed for all users of the computer, and
    emulation is enabled for all users as well. However, on this computer emulation is enabled on a
    per-user basis. There are two possible reasons for this:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 3ex">
        <li>either Microsoft Agent or Double Agent was installed only for this user,</li>
        <li style="margin-top: 8pt">the Microsoft Agent installation imposes security restrictions that prevent
            changes for all users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An unavoidable side effect of this situation is that Double Agent cannot emulate Microsoft Agent for
        any application running with administrative privileges.</p>
