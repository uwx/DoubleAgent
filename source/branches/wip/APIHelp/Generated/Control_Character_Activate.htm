					<h4>Remarks</h4>
					<p>
					Avoid calling this method directly after a <a href="Control_Character_Show.htm">Show</a> method.
					<a href="Control_Character_Show.htm">Show</a> automatically sets the input-active
					client. When the character is shown, the <s>Activate</s> call may fail if it gets processed before
					the <a href="Control_Character_Show.htm">Show</a> method completes.
				</p>
					<p>
						<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;
					Calling this method with <s>State</s> set to 1 does not typically
					generate an <a href="Control_Event_ActivateInput.htm">ActivateInput</a> event unless there are no other characters loaded or your application
					is already input-active.
				</p>
					<br />
					<h4>Details</h4>
					<p>
					When multiple characters are visible, only one of the characters receives speech input at a time. Similarly,
					when multiple client applications share the same character, only one of the clients receives mouse input
					(for example, <a href="Control_Event_Click.htm">Click</a> or <a href="Control_Event_DragStart.htm">Drag</a> events). The character set to receive mouse and
					speech input is the input-active character and the client that receives the input is the active client of
					that character. (The input-active character's window also appears at the top of the character window's z-order.)
					Typically, the user determines the input-active character by explicitly selecting the character. However,
					input activation also changes when a character is shown or hidden (the character becomes or is no
					longer input-active, respectively.)
				</p>
					<p>
					You can also use this method to explicitly manage when your client receives input directed to the character
					such as when your application itself becomes active. For example, setting <s>State</s> to 2 makes the
					character input-active and your client receives all mouse and speech input events generated from user interaction
					with the character. Therefore, it also makes your client the input-active client of the character.
				</p>
					<p>
					However, you can also set yourself to be the active client for a character without making the character
					input-active, by setting <s>State</s> to 1. This enables your client to receive input directed to that character
					when the character does become input-active. Similarly, you can set your client to <em>not</em> be the active client (not
					to receive input) when the character becomes input-active, by setting <s>State</s> to 0.
				</p>
					<p>
					If you call this method as a function, it returns a boolean value that indicates whether the method succeeded.
					Attempting to call this method with the <s>State</s> parameter set to 2 when the specified character
					is hidden will fail. Similarly, if you set <s>State</s> to 0 and your application is the only client,
					this call fails because a character must always have a input-active client.
