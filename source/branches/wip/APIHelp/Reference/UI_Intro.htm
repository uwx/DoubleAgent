				<h1>The Double Agent User Interface</h1>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="page">
				<p>The Double Agent user interface generally reproduces the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent user interface.
					Double Agent version 1.0 reproduces the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent 2.0 user interface quite faithfully,
					except that a few components (such as the <a class="see" href="#ListeningTip">Listening tip</a>) have
					been brought up-to-date.</p>
				<p>The Double Agent version 1.1 user interface has evolved a bit, but is still similar to Microsoft<sup>®</sup>
					Agent. Because Double Agent supports the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent international language components,
					the evolution of its user interface is limited.</p>
				<h4><a name="Character"></a>The Character Window</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>Normally, Double Agent displays animated characters in their own windows that float over other application
						windows. A user can move a character's window by dragging the character with the left mouse button.
						The character image moves with the pointer. An application can also move a character using the <em class="keyword">
							MoveTo</em> method.</p>
					<p>The Double Agent Control can also be used in <em class="glossary">contained</em> mode. It appears as
						a child window within an application and it's character is limited to its window. In this case, the
						user cannot move the character and the <em class="keyword">MoveTo</em> method is disabled.</p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="Menu"></a>The Pop-up Menu</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>When the user right-clicks a character, a pop-up menu appears:</p>
					<p>
						<img alt="Pop-up Menu" border="0" src="../images/MultiMenu.png" /></p>
					<p class="mini"><sup><b>*</b></sup> Commands listed are based on the input-active client. For more information
						on defining commands that appear in the pop-up menu, see the <a href="../Programming/Gen_Overview.htm">
						Double Agent API Overview</a>.</p>
					<p class="mini"><sup><b>**</b></sup> Entries listed are all other applications currently hosting the character.
						For more information on defining this entry, see the <a href="../Programming/Gen_Overview.htm">Double
						Agent API Overview</a>.</p>
					<p>The <em class="literal">Open/Close Voice Commands Window</em> command controls the display of the <a
					class="see" href="#VoiceCommands">Voice Commands</a> window for the current active character. If speech
						recognition services are disabled, this command is disabled. If speech recognition services are not
						installed, this command does not appear. </p>
					<p>The <em class="literal">Hide</em> command plays the animation assigned to the character's <em class="glossary">
						Hiding</em> state and then hides the character. If the character is already hidden, there will be a
						<em class="literal">Show</em> command instead.</p>
					<p>The commands for the character's active client application follow the <em class="literal">Hide</em> command,
						preceded by a separator. Then the names of other applications using the character appear, also preceded
						by a separator.</p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="Icon"></a>The Notification Icon</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>If a character has been authored to include an icon, or an icon is generated for the character, the icon
						appears in the notification area of the Windows<sup>®</sup> taskbar when the character is loaded. This
						icon provides access to the character's <a class="see" href="#Menu">pop-up menu</a>, which provides
						access to Double Agent's pre-defined commands such as those that hide and show the character.</p>
					<p>
						<img alt="Notification area with clock and icon" border="0" src="../images/TaskBarGen.png" /></p>
					<p>Moving the pointer over the <em class="self">notification icon</em> displays a tip window that reflects
						the name of the character (in the character's current language), or the tip text specified by the character's
						active client application. Single-clicking the character's <em class="self">notification icon</em> displays
						the character. The action associated with double-clicking the <em class="self">notification icon</em>
						depends on the application currently controlling that character.</p>
					<p>Right-clicking the <em class="self">notification icon</em> displays the <a class="see" href="#Menu">
					pop-up menu</a>. When the character is visible, the pop-up menu displays the same commands as those displayed
						when right-clicking the character. If the character is hidden, only the <em class="literal">Open Voice Commands
							Window</em> or <em class="literal">Close Voice Commands Window</em> and <em class="literal">Show</em>
						commands appear.</p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="Balloon"></a>The Word Balloon</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>In addition to spoken audio output, the Double Agent interface supports textual captioning in the form
						of text output in cartoon-style <em class="self">word balloons</em>. Words appear in the <em class="self">
							word balloon</em> as they are spoken. The <em class="self">word balloon</em> hides when spoken output
						is completed. The <a href="../Reference/UI_PropSheet.htm#Output">Advanced Character Options</a> window
						provides options to disable the <em class="self">word balloon's</em> display as well as control attributes
						related to its appearance.</p>
					<p>
						<img title="Yes master word balloon" border="0" src="../images/WordBalloon.png" /></p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="ListeningTip"></a>The Listening Tip</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>If speech input is enabled, a special tooltip window appears when the user presses the <em class="glossary">
						Listening key</em> to begin voice input. The <em class="self">Listening tip</em> displays contextual
						information related to the current input state of Double Agent. If compatible speech recognition has
						not been installed or has been disabled, the <em class="self">Listening tip</em> does not appear.</p>
					<p>
						<img title="Genie listening tip" border="0" src="../images/ListeningTip.png" /></p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="VoiceCommands"></a>The Voice Commands Window</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>If a compatible speech engine is installed, Double Agent supplies a special window called the <em
						class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> that displays the commands that have been voice-enabled for
						speech recognition. The <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> serves as a visual prompt for what
						can be spoken as input (commands cannot be selected with the mouse).</p>
					<p>
						<img alt="Voice Commands Window" border="0" src="../images/VoiceCommands.png" /></p>
					<p class="mini"><sup><b>*</b></sup> Commands listed are based on the input-active client. For more information
						on defining commands that appear in the pop-up menu, see the <a href="../Programming/Gen_Overview.htm">
						Double Agent API Overview</a>.</p>
					<p class="mini"><sup><b>**</b></sup> Entries listed are all other applications currently hosting the character.
						For more information on defining this entry, see the <a href="../Programming/Gen_Overview.htm">Double
						Agent API Overview</a>.</p>
					<p>The window appears when a user selects the <em class="literal">Open Voice Commands Window</em> command,
						either by speaking the command or right-clicking the character and choosing the command from the character's
						<a class="see" href="#Menu">pop-up menu</a>. However, if the user disables speech input, the <em class="self">
							Voice Commands Window</em> is not available.</p>
					<p>The <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> displays voice-enabled commands as an indented list.
						If the current hosting application supplies voice commands, they appear expanded and at the top of the
						window. Entries also appear for other applications using the character. The window also includes the
						<em class="glossary">Global Voice Commands</em> predefined by Double Agent. If the current hosting application
						has no voice commands, the <em class="glossary">Global Voice Commands</em> appear expanded and at the
						top of the window.</p>
					<p>The user can size and move the <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em>. Double Agent remembers the
						last location of the window and redisplays it at that location if the user closes and re-opens the window.
						If the entries in the window exceed the current display size of the window, scroll bars appear.</p>
