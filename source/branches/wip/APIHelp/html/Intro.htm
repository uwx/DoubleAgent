				<p><s>Microsoft® Agent</s> is a set of programmable software services that supports the presentation of
					interactive animated characters within the Microsoft Windows® interface. <s>Double Agent</s> is a set
					of open-source components that reproduce and extend the functionality of Microsoft® Agent.</p>
				<p>Developers can use Agent characters as interactive assistants to introduce, guide, entertain, or otherwise
					enhance their Web pages or applications in addition to the conventional use of windows, menus, and controls.</p>
				<p>Agent enables software developers and Web authors to incorporate a new form of user interaction, known
					as <em>conversational interfaces</em>, that leverages natural aspects of human social communication.
					In addition to mouse and keyboard input, Agent includes optional support for speech recognition so applications
					can respond to voice commands. Characters can respond using synthesized speech, recorded audio, or text
					in a cartoon word balloon.</p>
				<p>The conversational interface approach facilitated by Agent does not replace conventional graphical user
					interface (GUI) design. Instead, character interaction can be easily blended with the conventional interface
					components such as windows, menus, and controls to extend and enhance your application's interface.
