				<p><s>Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent</s> is a set of programmable software services that supports the presentation of
					interactive animated characters within the Microsoft Windows<sup>®</sup> interface. <s>Double Agent</s> is a set
					of open-source components that reproduce and extend the functionality of Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent.</p>
				<p>DeDevelopers can use Agent characters as interactive assistants to introduce, guide, entertain, or otherwise
					enhance their Web pages or applications.</p>
				<p>Agent allows software developers and Web authors to incorporate a form of user interaction, known as
					a <em>conversational interface</em>, that incorporates natural aspects of human social communication.
					In addition to mouse and keyboard input, Agent includes optional support for speech recognition so applications
					can respond to voice commands. Characters can respond using synthesized speech, recorded audio, or text
					in a cartoon word balloon.</p>
				<p>The conversational interface approach does not replace conventional graphical user interface (GUI) design.
					Instead, character interaction can be easily blended with the conventional interface components such
					as windows, menus, and controls to extend and enhance your application's interface.</p>
