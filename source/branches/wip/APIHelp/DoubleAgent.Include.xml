		<param name="Button">
			A numeric value that identifies which button was pressed and released to cause the
			event. The button argument is a bit field with bits corresponding to the left button (bit 0), right
			button (bit 1), and middle button (bit 2). These bits correspond to the values 1, 2, and 4, respectively.
			Only one of the bits is set, indicating the button that caused the event. If the character includes
			a taskbar icon, and bit 13 is also set, the click occurred on the taskbar icon.
		</param>
		<param name="Shift">
			A numeric value that corresponds to the state of the <c>SHIFT</c>, <c>CTRL</c>, and <c>ALT</c> keys when the
			button was pressed or released. A bit is set if the key is down. The
			shift argument is a bit field with the least-significant bits corresponding to the <c>SHIFT</c> key (bit 0),
			the <c>CTRL</c> key (bit 1), and the <c>ALT</c> key (bit 2). These bits correspond to the values 1, 2, and 4, respectively.
			Some, all, or none of the bits can be set, indicating
			that some, all, or none of the keys are pressed. For example, if both <c>CTRL</c> and <c>ALT</c> were pressed, the
			value of <em>Shift</em> would be 6.
