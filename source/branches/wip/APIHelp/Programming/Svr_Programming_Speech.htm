				<p>Although Double Agent includes support for synthesized speech output, a compatible text-to-speech (TTS)
					speech engine must be installed to access Double Agent's speech output features. Similarly, if you want
					to use Double Agent's speech features to support speech input for a character, you must install a compatible
					command-and-control speech recognition engine.</p>
				<p>To produce text-to-speech output, use the <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_Speak.htm">
				Speak</a> method. Double Agent will automatically attempt to load an engine that matches the character's
					<a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_LanguageID.htm">LanguageID</a>. If the character's
					definition includes a specific <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_TTSModeID.htm">
					TTSModeID</a> and that engine is available and matches the character's <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_LanguageID.htm">
					LanguageID</a>, Double Agent loads that engine for the character. If not, Agent loads the first TTS
					engine that SAPI returns as matching the character's language setting. You can also use the <a class="see keyword"
					href="../Generated/Server_Character_TTSModeID.htm">TTSModeID</a> property to load a specific engine.
					The <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_TTSEngines.htm">TTSEngines</a> collection will
					help you determine which engines are available and which ones are compatible with the character.</p>
				<p>To enable speech input support in your application, define a <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Command.htm">
				Command</a> object and set its <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Command_VoiceCaption.htm">
				Voice Caption</a> property. Double Agent will automatically load speech services, so that when the user
					presses the <em class="glossary">Listening key</em> or you call <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_Listen.htm">
					Listen</a>, the speech recognition engine will be loaded. By default the character's <a class="see keyword"
					href="../Generated/Server_Character_LanguageID.htm">LanguageID</a> will determine which engine is loaded.
					Double Agent attempts to load the first engine that the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Speech API (SAPI) returns
					as matching this language. Use the <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_SRModeID.htm">
					SRModeID</a> property if you want to load a specific engine. The <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_SREngines.htm">
					SREngines</a> collection will help you determine which engines are available and which ones are compatible
					with the character.</p>
				<p>Typically, Double Agent loads a text-to-speech engine when <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_Speak.htm">
				Speak</a> is first called and a speech recognition when the <em class="glossary">Listening mode</em> is
					initiated. However, if you want to preload the speech engine, you can query the properties related to
					the speech interfaces. For example, querying <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_TTSModeID.htm">
					TTSModeID</a> or <a class="see keyword" href="../Generated/Server_Character_SRModeID.htm">SRModeID</a>
					will attempt to load that type of engine.</p>
				<p>Because Double Agent's speech features are based on the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Speech API, you can use
					any engines that support the required speech interfaces. The Double Agent 32-bit build supports Microsoft<sup>®</sup>
					Speech (SAPI) versions 4 and 5 for text-to-speech and version 5 for speech recognition. The Double Agent
					64-bit build supports only version 5 for both text-to-speech and speech recognition.</p>
