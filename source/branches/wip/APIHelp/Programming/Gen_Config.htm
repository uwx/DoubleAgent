				<p>Double Agent includes support for user preferences. These preferences apply to all client applications
					and can only be set by the end-user. However, client applications can query the current preference settings.</p>
				<p>Double Agent also uses some resources that are installed and configured independently, and are therefore
					not under its control. Specifically, this includes character definition files and speech engines. Double
					Agent provides services that allow client applications to discover what resources are available.</p>

						<p>The <em class="self">Advanced Character Options</em> window allows users to customize their interactions
							with all characters. For example, users can disable speech input or change speech input preferences.
							Users can also change the output settings for the word balloon. These settings override any set by a
							client application or declared as part of the character definition.</p>
						<p>Your application cannot change or disable these options, because they are the <em>user's</em> preferences
							for <em>all</em> characters. However, the server will notify your application with the <em class="keyword">
								AgentPropertyChange</em> or <em class="keyword">DefaultCharacterChange</em> event when the user
							applies changes to these settings.</p>
						<p>The preference settings can be accessed using the <em class="keyword">Settings</em> object. You can also
							display or close the window using the <em class="keyword">PropertySheet</em> object's <em class="keyword">
								Visible</em> property, and access its location through its <em class="keyword">Left</em>, <em class="keyword">
									Top</em>, <em class="keyword">Width</em>, and <em class="keyword">Height</em> properties.</p>
