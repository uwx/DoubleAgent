				<p>The Double Agent control can operate in three different modes: <em class="glossary">connected</em>, <em
					class="glossary">stand-alone</em>, and <em class="glossary">contained</em>. The mode a developer chooses
					depends on the application&#39;s requirements.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>
						<h4><a name="connected"></a>Connected Mode</h4>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><em class="glossary">Connected</em> mode is the control's default mode, and is compatible with Microsoft<sup>®</sup>
							Agent. In this mode, the Double Agent control acts as a gateway to the Double Agent server. The control
							provides all of its services through it's connection with the server. It automatically connects to the
							server as required, and releases the connection when it's no longer needed.</p>
						<p>When operating in <em class="glossary">connected</em> mode, all of the control's characters belong to
							the <em>server</em>. This means that all client applications share a <em>single</em> copy of the character's
							<a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Character">window</a>, <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Menu">
							pop-up menu</a>, <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Icon">notification icon</a>, <a class="see"
							href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Balloon">word balloon</a>, <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#ListeningTip">
							listening tip</a>, speech engines, etc.</p>
						<p>Other server resources such as the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_PropSheet.htm">Advanced Character
						Options</a> window and the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#VoiceCommands">Voice Commands</a> window
							are also shared by all client applications.</p>
						<p>If the control is contained in a form, it will <em>not</em> be visible at run-time.</p>
						<p>A character window floats on top of all application windows and is <em>not</em> visually associated with
							a specific client application. It can produce Text-to-Speech output and receive mouse, keyboard, and
							Speech Recognition input even if the client application's window is inactive (not in the foreground)
							or disabled. It can even be used by a client application that has no visible window.</p>
						<p>The <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Balloon">word balloon</a>, the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#ListeningTip">
						listening tip</a>, and the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#VoiceCommands">Voice Commands</a> window
							are also <em class="glossary">topmost</em> windows, and the <em class="glossary">Listening key</em>
							is always available.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<h4><a name="standalone"></a>Stand-alone Mode</h4>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In <em class="glossary">stand-alone</em> mode, the Double Agent control is <em>not</em> connected to
							the Double Agent server. It provides the server's functionality directly.</p>
						<p>When operating in <em class="glossary">stand-alone</em> mode, all of the control's characters belong
							to the <em>control</em>. Since the control runs in the same process as the client application, this
							means that the client application has it's own private copy of its characters and all of their resources.
							The control also has its own copy of <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#VoiceCommands"></a>the
							<a class="see" href="../html/UI_PropSheet.htm">Advanced Character Options</a> window and the <a class="see"
							href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#VoiceCommands">Voice Commands</a> window.</p>
						<p>If the control is contained in a form, it will <em>not</em> be visible at run-time.</p>
						<p>A character window floats on top of the application window containing the Double Agent control, but <em>
							not</em> other application windows. It is visually associated with your client application as an <em
								class="glossary">owned popup</em> of the control's parent window - that is, it's hidden when the
							control's parent window is minimized. However, the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Icon">notification
							icon</a> remains visible.</p>
						<p>The <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#Balloon">word balloon</a>, the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#ListeningTip">
						listening tip</a>, and the <a class="see" href="../html/UI_Intro.htm#VoiceCommands">Voice Commands</a> window
							are also <em class="glossary">owned popups</em> of the control's parent window, and the <em class="glossary">
								Listening key</em> is available only when your application is in the foreground.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>
						<h4><a name="contained"></a>Contained Mode</h4>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In <em class="glossary">contained</em> mode, the Double Agent control is a <em>visible</em> child window
							of it's containing form. Like <em class="glossary">stand-alone</em> mode, the control is not connected
							to the server and it's characters are owned by the client application. Unlike <em class="glossary">stand-alone</em>
							mode, the character is not a floating window; it's displayed within the control's child window.</p>
						<p><em class="glossary">Contained</em> mode applies to a <em>single</em> character of a control that's operating
							in <em class="glossary">stand-alone</em> mode. The control can load multiple characters, but only one
							can be contained. When there is a <em class="glossary">contained</em> character, the control will be
							visible. If there is no <em class="glossary">contained</em> character, the control will <em>not</em>
							be visible.</p>
						<p>The <em class="glossary">contained</em> character is set by the client application at run-time, so the
							control can dynamically change to and from <em class="glossary">contained</em> mode. Also, even when
							there's a <em class="glossary">contained</em> character, other characters can be shown as floating (uncontained)
							windows.</p>
