				<p>To animate a character, you must first load the character. Use the <a href="../Generated/Control_Characters_Load.htm">
					Load</a> method to load the character's data. Double Agent supports two formats for character and 
					animation data: a single structured file and separate files. Typically, you use the single file 
					format (.ACS) when the data is stored locally. The multiple file format (.ACF, .ACA) works best when 
					you want to download animations individually, such as when accessing animations from an HTTP server.</p>
				<p>A Double Agent control or server client can load only a single instance of the same character. Any 
					attempt to load the same character more than once will fail. However, an application can load the same 
					character multiple times by providing separate connections to Double Agent. For example, an 
					application could load the same character from two copies of the Double Agent control.</p>
				<p>Even if an application loads multiple instances of the same character from multiple clients of the 
					Double Agent server, or from multiple copies of the Double Agent control connected to the 
					server, only a single instance of the character will be created by the server. It will be 
					shared by all of the clients that use it.</p>
				<p>However, when the Double Agent control is used in stand-alone mode (not connected to the server) then 
					a single instance of each loaded character is created for the Windows <em>process</em> that owns the 
					control(s).&nbsp; Generally, an application has only a single process, and each application has a 
					different process.</p>
