				<p>Spoken output can also appear as textual output in the form of a cartoon word balloon. This can be used
					to supplement the spoken output of a character or as an alternative to audio output when you use the
					<b>Speak</b> method.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/f3ballon.gif" alt="Yes master word balloon" border="0"></p>
				<p>You can also use a word balloon to communicate what a character is "thinking" using the <b>Think</b>
					method. This displays the text you supply in a still "thought" balloon. The <b>Think</b> method also
					differs from the <b>Speak</b> method in that it produces no audio output.</p>
				<p>Word balloons support only captioned communication from the character, <i>not</i> user input. Therefore,
					the word balloon does not support input controls. However, you can easily provide user input for a character,
					using interfaces from your programming language or the other input services provided by Microsoft Agent,
					such as the pop-up menu.</p>
				<p>When you define a character, you can specify whether to include word balloon support. However, if you
					use a character that includes word balloon support, you cannot disable the support.</p>
