				<p>The <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> displays the current active voice commands available

					is chosen or the <em class="keyword">Visible</em> property of the <em class="keyword">CommandsWindow</em>
					object is set to <em class="keyword">True</em>. If the speech engine has not yet been loaded, querying
					or setting this property will cause Double Agent to attempt to initialize the engine. If the user disables
					speech, the window can still display; however, it will include a text message that informs the user
					that speech is currently disabled.</p>
				<p>The <a class="see" href="Gen_Input.htm#Active">input-active</a> client's commands appear in the <em
					class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> based on the <em class="keyword">VoiceCaption</em> and <em class="keyword">
						VoiceGrammar</em> property settings, listed under the <em class="keyword">VoiceCaption</em> of their
					<em class="keyword">Commands</em> collection. </p>
				<p>The <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> also lists the <em class="keyword">VoiceCaption</em>
					of the <em class="keyword">Commands</em> collection for other clients of the character, and the following
					server-generated voice commands for general interaction under the <em class="literal">Global Commands</em>
					entry:</p>

				<p>Speaking the voice command for another client's <em class="keyword">Commands</em> collection switches
					to that client, and the <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> displays the commands of that client.
					No other entries are expanded. Similarly, if the user switches characters, the <em class="self">Voice Commands
						Window</em> changes to display the commands of its <a class="see" href="Gen_Input.htm#Active">input-active</a>
					client. If the client is already <a class="see" href="Gen_Input.htm#Active">input-active</a>, speaking
					one of its voice commands has no effect. (However, if the user collapses the active client's sub-tree
					with the mouse, speaking the client name redisplays the client's sub-tree.)</p>
				<p>If a client has voice commands, but no <em class="keyword">VoiceGrammar</em> setting for its <em class="keyword">
					Commands</em> object (or no <em class="keyword">VoiceCaption</em>), the tree displays &quot;(command
					undefined)&quot; as the parent entry - but only when that client is <a class="see" href="Gen_Input.htm#Active">
					input-active</a> and the client has commands in its collection that have <em class="keyword">VoiceCaption</em>
					and <em class="keyword">VoiceGrammar</em> settings.</p>
				<p>The server automatically displays the commands of the current <a class="see" href="Gen_Input.htm#Active">
				input-active</a> client and, if necessary, scrolls the window to display as many of the client's commands
					as possible, based on the size of the window. If the character has no client entries, the <em class="literal">
						Global Commands</em> entry is expanded.</p>
				<p>If the user speaks <em class="glossary">Global Commands</em>, the <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em>
					always displays its associated sub-tree entries. If they are already displayed, the command has no effect.</p>
				<p>Although you can also display or hide the <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> from your application's
					code using the <em class="keyword">Visible</em> property, you cannot change the <em class="self">Voice
						Commands Window</em> size or location. The server maintains the <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em>'s
					properties based on the user's interaction with the window. Its initial location is immediately adjacent
					to the character's taskbar icon.</p>
				<p>The <em class="self">Voice Commands Window</em> is included in the ALT+TAB window order. This enables
					a user to switch to the window to scroll, resize, or reposition the window with the keyboard.</p>
