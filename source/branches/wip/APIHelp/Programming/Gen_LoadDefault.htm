				<p>Instead of loading a specific character directly by specifying its file name, you can load the <i>default
					character</i>. Using the default character allows the user to choose the specific character to use in
					the <a href="Gen_PropSheet.htm">Double Agent Property Sheet</a>, or the Double Agent Control Panel.</p>
				<p>However, because the default character is intended for general-purpose use and may be shared by other
					applications at the same time, avoid loading the default character when you want a character exclusively
					for your application.</p>
				<p>To load the default character, call the <a href="../Generated/Control_Characters_Load.htm">Load</a> method
					without specifying a file name or path. Double Agent automatically loads the default character. If the
					user has not yet selected a default character, Double Agent will select the first character it finds.
					If none is available, the method will fail and report back the cause.</p>
				<p>Although a client application can query the identity of the default character, only the user can change
					it. You can use the <a href="../Generated/Control_Control_ShowDefaultCharacterProperties.htm">ShowDefaultCharacterProperties</a>
					method to display the <em>Gallery</em> page of the <a href="Gen_PropSheet.htm">Double Agent Property Sheet</a>.</p>
				<p>The server will notify clients that have loaded the default character when a user changes the default
					character selection, and pass the GUID of the new character. The server automatically unloads the former
					character and reloads the new character. The queues of any clients that have loaded the default character
					are halted and flushed. However, the queues of clients that have loaded the character explicitly using
					the character's file name are not affected. If necessary, the server also handles automatically resetting
					the text-to-speech (TTS) engine for the new character.</p>
