				<p>Double Agent's animation services manage the animation and movement of a character's image on the screen.
					An animation is defined as a sequence of timed and optionally branched frames, composed of one or more
					images.</p>
				<p>While Microsoft Agent's animation services are only available through it's server, the Double Agent control
					can run in stand-alone mode, not connected to the Double Agent server. When the shared server is used,
					each character can only be loaded <em>once per user</em> and is shared by all applications that use
					it. When the Double Agent control is used stand-alone, each character can be loaded <em>once per process</em>.
					If multiple applications use the same character in stand-alone mode, there will be multiple copies of
					the character (one per application).</p>
				<p>If multiple copies of the same character are shown as pop-up windows, it will be confusing to the user.
					Application developers are encouraged to use stand-alone characters only when using the Double Agent
					control as a <em>child</em> window. This will make it obvious to the user which application that particular
					instance of the character belongs to.</p>
