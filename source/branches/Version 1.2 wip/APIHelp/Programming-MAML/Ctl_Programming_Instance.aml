			<para>
				Accessing <token>DA</token>'s control requires that you first create an instance of the control. The easiest
				way to do this is to place an instance of the control on a form. You may have to add the control to
				your toolbox before adding it to your form. Depending on your programming language, you may also be
				able to create the control at runtime.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you plan to show a character as a <token>Popup</token> that floats over other windows on the desktop (as implemented
				by <token>MA</token>), then you can use the control either as part of a form or dynamically
				created at runtime. If the control is part of a form it will be invisible at runtime, so the only difference
				is whether or not you want the control&#39;s lifetime to be tied to that of the form.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you want to show a character within a form, you should use the <token>ActiveXCtl</token> or
				<token>WinFormsCtl</token> as part of the form definition. Use the control&#39;s
				<codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:DoubleAgent.Control.Control.AutoConnect</codeEntityReference>,
				<codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:DoubleAgent.Control.Control.Connected</codeEntityReference>,
				and <codeEntityReference qualifyHint="false">P:DoubleAgent.Control.Control.ControlCharacter</codeEntityReference>
				properties to make the control visible at runtime, with the character shown within it&#39;s boundaries.
