		<introduction>
			<para>
				Double Agent includes support for user preferences. These preferences apply to all client applications
				and can only be set by the end-user. However, client applications can query the current preference settings.
			</para>
			<para>
				Double Agent also uses some resources that are installed and configured independently, and are therefore
				not under its control. Specifically, this includes character definition files and speech engines. Double
				Agent provides services that allow client applications to discover what resources are available.

			<content>
				<para>
					The <token>AdvancedCharacterOptions</token> window allows users to customize their interactions
					with all characters. For example, users can disable speech input or change speech input preferences.
					Users can also change the output settings for the <link xlink:href="e0846713-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">
						<token>WordBalloon</token>
					</link>. These settings override any set by a client application or declared as part of the character
					definition.
				</para>
				<para>
					Your application cannot change or disable these options, because they are the <legacyItalic>user's</legacyItalic> preferences
					for <legacyItalic>all</legacyItalic> characters. However, the server will notify your application with the
					<unmanagedCodeEntityReference>AgentPropertyChange</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> or
					<unmanagedCodeEntityReference>DefaultCharacterChange</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> event when the user
					applies changes to these settings.
				</para>
				<para>
					The preference settings can be accessed using the <unmanagedCodeEntityReference>Settings</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> object. You can also
					display or close the window using the <unmanagedCodeEntityReference>PropertySheet</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> object's
					<unmanagedCodeEntityReference>Visible</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> property, and access its location through its
					<unmanagedCodeEntityReference>Left</unmanagedCodeEntityReference>, <unmanagedCodeEntityReference>Top</unmanagedCodeEntityReference>,
					<unmanagedCodeEntityReference>Width</unmanagedCodeEntityReference>, and <unmanagedCodeEntityReference>Height</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> properties.

			<title>Local Character Files</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					Character definition files are installed independently and can be added or removed at any time. They
					can also be installed in different locations: with Double Agent, with <token>MsAgent</token>, or
					with older versions of Microsoft<superscript>®</superscript> Office.
				</para>
				<para>
					Double Agent provides services for discovering which character files are installed and where they are
					located.

		<section address="InstalledSpeech">
			<title>Installed Speech Engines</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					Text-to-Speech engines and Speech Recognition engines are also installed independently from Double Agent.
					If an Agent character is designed to use a specific speech engine that is not installed, Double Agent
					will automatically use the speech engine that most closely matches the character&#39;s language and
					gender requirements.
				</para>
				<para>
					However, a client application can also choose a specific Text-to-Speech or Speech Recognition engine.
					Double Agent provides services that allow the client application to discover the installed speech engines
					and to match them against a character&#39;s requirements. These services also make it easy for the client
					application to let the <legacyItalic>user</legacyItalic> choose an appropriate speech engine.
