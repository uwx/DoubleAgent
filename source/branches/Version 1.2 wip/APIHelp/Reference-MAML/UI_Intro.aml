		<introduction>
			<para>
				The <token>DA</token> user interface generally reproduces the <token>MA</token> user interface.
				<token>DA</token> version 1.0 reproduces the <token>MA</token> 2.0 user interface quite faithfully,
				except that a few components (such as the <link xlink:href="#ListeningTip">
					<token>ListeningTip</token>
				</link>) have
				been brought up-to-date.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <token>DA</token> version 1.1 user interface has evolved a bit, but is still similar to <token>MA</token>.
				Because <token>DA</token> supports the <token>MA</token> international language components,
				the evolution of its user interface is limited.

				<para>
					Normally, <token>DA</token> displays animated characters in their own windows that float over other application
					windows. A user can move a character's window by dragging the character with the left mouse button.
					The character image moves with the pointer. An application can also move a character using the
					<unmanagedCodeEntityReference>MoveTo</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> method.
				</para>
				<para>
					The <token>DA</token> Control can also be used in <token>contained</token> mode. It appears as
					a child window within an application and it's character is limited to its window. In this case, the
					user cannot move the character and the <unmanagedCodeEntityReference>MoveTo</unmanagedCodeEntityReference> method is disabled.

						</para>
					</listItem>
				</list>
				<para>
					The <ui>Open/Close Voice Commands Window</ui> command controls the display of the <link xlink:href="#VoiceCommands">
						<token>VoiceCommands</token>
					</link> window for the current active character. If speech
					recognition services are disabled, this command is disabled. If speech recognition services are not
					installed, this command does not appear.
				</para>
				<para>
					The <ui>Hide</ui> command plays the animation assigned to the character's <newTerm>Hiding</newTerm>
					state and then hides the character. If the character is already hidden, there will be a
					<newTerm>Show</newTerm> command instead.
				</para>
				<para>
					The commands for the character's active client application follow the <ui>Hide</ui> command,
					preceded by a separator. Then the names of other applications using the character appear, also preceded
					by a separator.
				</para>

		<section address="Icon">
			<title>
				The <token>NotificationIconUc</token>
			</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					If a character has been authored to include an icon, or an icon is generated for the character, the icon
					appears in the notification area of the <token>Windows</token> taskbar when the character is loaded. This
					icon provides access to the character's <link xlink:href="#Menu">
						<token>PopupMenu</token>
					</link>, which provides
					access to <token>DA</token>'s pre-defined commands such as those that hide and show the character.
				</para>
				<mediaLink>
					<image xlink:href="TaskBarGen" />
				</mediaLink>
				<para>
					Moving the pointer over the <token>NotificationIcon</token> displays a tip window that reflects
					the name of the character (in the character's current language), or the tip text specified by the character's
					active client application. Single-clicking the character's <token>NotificationIcon</token> displays
					the character. The action associated with double-clicking the <token>NotificationIcon</token>
					depends on the application currently controlling that character.
				</para>
				<para>
					Right-clicking the <token>NotificationIcon</token> displays the <link xlink:href="#Menu">
						<token>PopupMenu</token>
					</link>.
					When the character is visible, the <token>PopupMenu</token> displays the same commands as those displayed
					when right-clicking the character. If the character is hidden, only the
					<ui>Open Voice Commands Window</ui>
					or <ui>Close Voice Commands Window</ui> and <ui>Show</ui>
					commands appear.
				</para>

				The <token>WordBalloonUc</token>
			</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					In addition to spoken audio output, the <token>DA</token> interface supports textual captioning in the form
					of text output in cartoon-style <token>WordBalloon</token>s. Words appear in the
					<token>WordBalloon</token> as they are spoken. The <token>WordBalloon</token> hides when spoken output
					is completed. The <link xlink:href="e08466be-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Output">
						<token>AdvancedCharacterOptions</token>
					</link> window
					provides options to disable the <token>WordBalloon</token>'s display as well as control attributes
					related to its appearance.

			<content>
				<para>
					If speech input is enabled, a special tooltip window appears when the user presses the
					<token>ListeningKey</token> to begin voice input. <token>ListeningTip</token> displays contextual
					information related to the current input state of <token>DA</token>. If compatible speech recognition has
					not been installed or has been disabled, the <token>ListeningTip</token> does not appear.

		<section address="VoiceCommands">
			<title>
				The <token>VoiceCommands</token> Window
			</title>
			<content>
				<para>
					If a compatible speech engine is installed, <token>DA</token> supplies a special window called the
					<token>VoiceCommands</token> window that displays the commands that have been voice-enabled for
					speech recognition. The <token>VoiceCommands</token> window serves as a visual prompt for what
					can be spoken as input (commands cannot be selected with the mouse).

						</para>
					</listItem>
				</list>
				<para>
					The window appears when a user selects the <ui>Open Voice Commands Window</ui> command,
					either by speaking the command or right-clicking the character and choosing the command from the character's
					<link xlink:href="#Menu">
						<token>PopupMenu</token>
					</link>. However, if the user disables speech input, the
					<token>VoiceCommands</token> window is not available.
				</para>
				<para>
					The <token>VoiceCommands</token> window displays voice-enabled commands as an indented list.
					If the current hosting application supplies voice commands, they appear expanded and at the top of the
					window. Entries also appear for other applications using the character. The window also includes the
					<ui>Global Voice Commands</ui> predefined by <token>DA</token>. If the current hosting application
					has no voice commands, the <ui>Global Voice Commands</ui> appear expanded and at the
					top of the window.
				</para>
				<para>
					The user can size and move the <token>VoiceCommands</token> window. <token>DA</token> remembers the
					last location of the window and redisplays it at that location if the user closes and re-opens the window.
					If the entries in the window exceed the current display size of the window, scroll bars appear.
