		<introduction>
			<para>
				<token>MA</token>
				is a set of programmable software services that supports the presentation of
				interactive animated characters within a <token>Windows</token> user interface. <token>DA</token> is a set
				of open-source components that reproduce and extend the functionality of <token>MA</token>.
			</para>
			<para>
				Developers can use <token>Agent</token> characters as interactive assistants to introduce, guide, entertain, or otherwise
				enhance their Web pages or applications.
			</para>
			<para>
				<token>Agent</token> allows software developers and Web authors to incorporate a form of user interaction, known as
				a <newTerm>conversational interface</newTerm>, that incorporates natural aspects of human social communication.
				In addition to mouse and keyboard input, <token>Agent</token> includes optional support for speech recognition so applications
				can respond to voice commands. Characters can respond using synthesized speech, recorded audio, or text
				in a cartoon <token>WordBalloon</token>.
			</para>
			<para>
				The conversational interface approach does not replace conventional graphical user interface (GUI) design.
				Instead, character interaction can be easily blended with the conventional interface components such
				as windows, menus, and controls to extend and enhance your application's interface.
