				<p>Double Agent includes support for user preferences. These preferences apply to all client applications
					and can only be set by the end-user. However, client applications can query the current preference settings.</p>
				<p>Double Agent also uses some resources that are installed and configured independently, and are therefore
					not under its control. Specifically, this includes character definition files and speech engines. Double
					Agent provides services that allow client applications to discover what resources are available.</p>
				<h4><a name="PropSheet"></a>The Advanced Character Options Window</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>The <em class="self">Advanced Character Options</em> window allows users to customize their interactions
						with all characters. For example, users can disable speech input or change speech input preferences.
						Users can also change the output settings for the <a class="see" href="Gen_Output.htm#Balloon">word
						balloon</a>. These settings override any set by a client application or declared as part of the character
						definition.</p>
					<p>Your application cannot change or disable these options, because they are the <em>user's</em> preferences
						for <em>all</em> characters. However, the server will notify your application with the <em class="keyword">
							AgentPropertyChange</em> or <em class="keyword">DefaultCharacterChange</em> event when the user
						applies changes to these settings.</p>
					<p>The preference settings can be accessed using the <em class="keyword">Settings</em> object. You can also
						display or close the window using the <em class="keyword">PropertySheet</em> object's <em class="keyword">
							Visible</em> property, and access its location through its <em class="keyword">Left</em>, <em class="keyword">
								Top</em>, <em class="keyword">Width</em>, and <em class="keyword">Height</em> properties.</p>
					<p class="note"><span class="note">Note: </span>The Double Agent <em class="self">Advanced Character Options</em>
						window combines the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent <em class="self">Advanced Character Options</em> window
						and the Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent <em class="self">Default Character Properties</em> window.</p>
					<p class="note"><span class="note">Note: </span>The pages in the <em class="self">Advanced Character Options</em>
						window are also included in the <em class="self">Double Agent Control Panel</em>.</p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="InstalledFiles"></a>Local Character Files</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>Character definition files are installed independently and can be added or removed at any time. They
						can also be installed in different locations: with Double Agent, with Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Agent, or
						with older versions of Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Office.</p>
					<p>Double Agent provides services for discovering which character files are installed and where they are
						located.</p>
				</div>
				<h4><a name="InstalledSpeech"></a>Installed Speech Engines</h4>
				<div class="indent">
					<p>Text-to-Speech engines and Speech Recognition engines are also installed independently from Double Agent.
						If an Agent character is designed to use a specific speech engine that is not installed, Double Agent
						will automatically use the speech engine that most closely matches the character&#39;s language and
						gender requirements.</p>
					<p>However, a client application can also choose a specific Text-to-Speech or Speech Recognition engine.
						Double Agent provides services that allow the client application to discover the installed speech engines
						and to match them against a character&#39;s requirements. These services also make it easy for the client
						application to let the <em>user</em> choose an appropriate speech engine.</p>
