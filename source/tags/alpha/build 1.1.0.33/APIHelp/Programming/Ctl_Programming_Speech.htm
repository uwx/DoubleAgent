				<p>Although Double Agent includes support for speech input, a compatible command-and-control speech recognition
					engine must be installed to access Double Agent's speech input features. Similarly, if you want to use
					Double Agent's speech features to support synthesized speech output for a character, you must install
					a compatible text-to-speech (TTS) speech engine for your character.</p>
				<p>To enable speech input support in your application, define a <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Command.htm">
					Command</a> object and set its <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Command_VoiceCaption.htm">Voice Caption</a>
					property. Double Agent will automatically load speech services, so that when the user presses the <em>Listening</em>
					key or you call <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_Listen.htm">Listen</a>, the speech recognition engine will be loaded. By default the character's
					<a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_LanguageID.htm">LanguageID</a> will determine which engine is
					loaded. Double Agent attempts to load the first engine that the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) returns
					as matching this language. Use <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_SRModeID.htm">SRModeID</a> if
					you want to load a specific engine.</p>
				<p>To enable text-to-speech output, use the <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_Speak.htm">Speak</a>
					method. Double Agent will automatically attempt to load an engine that matches the character's <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_LanguageID.htm">
					LanguageID</a>. If the character's definition includes a specific <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_TTSModeID.htm">
					TTSModeID</a> and that engine is available and matches the character's <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_LanguageID.htm">LanguageID</a>, Double
					Agent loads that engine for the character. If it is not, Double Agent loads the first TTS engine that
					SAPI returns as matching the character's language setting. You can also use the <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_TTSModeID.htm">
					TTSModeID</a> to load a specific engine.</p>
				<p>Typically, Agent loads speech recognition when the <em>Listening</em> mode is initiated and a text-to-speech
					engine when <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_Speak.htm">Speak</a> is first called. However, if
					you want to preload the speech engine, you query the properties related to the speech interfaces. For
					example, querying <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_SRModeID.htm">SRModeID</a> or <a class=see href="../Generated/Control_Character_TTSModeID.htm">
					TTSModeID</a> will attempt to load that type of engine.</p>
				<p>Because Double Agent's speech features are based on the Microsoft Speech API, you can use any engines
					that support the required speech interfaces. The Double Agent 32-bit build supports Microsoft Speech
					(SAPI) versions 4 and 5 for text-to-speech and version 5 for speech recognition. The Double Agent 64-bit
					build supports only version 5 for both text-to-speech and speech recognition.</p>
